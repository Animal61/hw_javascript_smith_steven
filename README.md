## Resources

* [Array prototype push](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push)

    * I referenced this section to learn more about adding elements to an existing Array

* [Expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)

    * I referenced this section to provide some further information on Expressions

* [Callback function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function)

    * After working with the instructor I did some research on the callback function. The example provided much needed clarification to the inception portion of the assignment

## Deductions

I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

## Comments

This assignment was a bit more difficult. I do have a better understanding on some of the requirements when working with strings, especially when comparing using conditional statements.
